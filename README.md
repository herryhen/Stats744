This may be one of the times when pie charts are the best option as it resembles earth's (somewhat) spherical shape to present surface land cover. We hear about how earth's surface is 70% water and how humans are densely located in a very very small percentage of land, which is why we were told not to worry when China's rocket went haywire and was hurling towards earth. This shows the grandness of water cover on earth but it would be better if it also included the percentage of land used up by people by country. Another problem I have is determining whether the percentage land cover by country is of the 30% land cover or if it is of the entire world.
