The chosen table shows the various measurements taken at the four sites to look at the effects of the WWTP on the water quality. The multiplot figure I created compares the four sites for all the measurements in the order of the water flow with the exception of the reference site. The colour gradient of red also represents the proximity to the site of interest, the WWTP. With these graphs, some trends may be easier to see than in a table format. For example, the dissolved oxygen is the lowest at the WWTP and gradually increases with distance from the WWTP (downstream of it), and it is noticably higher in the reference site. I think it makes sense to compare each metric by the site since that tells the story of generally poorer water quality at the WWTP. Rather, if I create 4 graphs for each of the sites, the measurements will be difficult to compare. Bar graphs were chosen because they represent a quantity that is imaginable or proportional to what was measured at the site.
